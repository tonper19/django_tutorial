Namespacing URL names¶
The tutorial project has just one app, polls. In real Django projects, there 
might be five, ten, twenty apps or more. How does Django differentiate the URL 
names between them? For example, the polls app has a detail view, and so might 
an app on the same project that is for a blog. How does one make it so that 
Django knows which app view to create for a url when using the {% url %} 
template tag?

The answer is to add namespaces to your URLconf. In the polls/urls.py file, go 
ahead and add an app_name to set the application namespace:

polls/urls.py
    from django.urls import path

    from . import views

    app_name = 'polls'
    urlpatterns = [
        path('', views.index, name='index'),
        path('<int:question_id>/', views.detail, name='detail'),
        path('<int:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results'),
        path('<int:question_id>/vote/', views.vote, name='vote'),
    ]

Now change your polls/index.html template from:

polls/templates/polls/index.html¶
    <li>
        <a href="{% url 'detail' question.id %}">
            {{ question.question_text }}
        </a>
    </li>

to point at the namespaced detail view:

polls/templates/polls/index.html¶
<li>
    <a href="{% url 'polls:detail' question.id %}">
        {{ question.question_text }}
    </a>
</li>
