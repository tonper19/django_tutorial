Creating the Polls app¶
Now that your environment – a “project” – is set up, you’re set to start doing 
work.

Each application you write in Django consists of a Python package that follows 
a certain convention. Django comes with a utility that automatically generates 
the basic directory structure of an app, so you can focus on writing code 
rather than creating directories.

Projects vs. apps

What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a Web application 
that does something – e.g., a Weblog system, a database of public records or a 
small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a 
particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in 
multiple projects.

Your apps can live anywhere on your Python path. In this tutorial, we’ll create 
our poll app in the same directory as your manage.py file so that it can be 
imported as its own top-level module, rather than a submodule of mysite.

To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and 
type this command:


$ python manage.py startapp polls

That’ll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:

polls/
    __init__.py
    admin.py
    apps.py
    migrations/
        __init__.py
    models.py
    tests.py
    views.py
This directory structure will house the poll application.
